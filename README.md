Data Joining: Both datasets dl1c and dl22 are stripped off of the extraneous header and footer data. The column names are renamed to contain only lowercase letters and no spaces. The index values are sanitized by discarding the digits, forward slashes and whitespaces. The object datatypes in d1lc are converted to numeric types. The dl22 dataset are stripped off of the blank columns. The duplicated “State” column is also discarded. After making sure that the index columns in both dataframes match exactly, a merge is performed on the indexes and the row and column counts tallied to confirm the join worked as intended. The snapshot of the jupyter notebook, the resultant dl_df.csv and the source code in plain text are pasted below.
